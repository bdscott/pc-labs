		<p>Students deserve more from their STEM education than a class in Microsoft Word. At Punchcard, we believe that students should be taught not just to <em>use</em> the technology of the moment, but how to craft creative solutions to the problems of the future.</p> 
		<p>Even students who pursue careers outside of technology will benefit from an understanding of computer science. Apple founder Steve Jobs said, "I think everyone should learn how to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think."</p>
		<p>We agree, and we believe that students learn best when taught by masters of the craft. Here at Punchcard Labs, we're working hard to place talented tech professionals in classrooms across the country, where they will teach the fundamentals of design and computer programming.</p>
		<p>Although we would like to partner with every interested school, our capacity is limited. If you believe that your school might be a good fit for Punchcard, <a href="">let us know when we can give you a call</a>.</p>
