		<p>Students deserve more from their STEM education than a class in word processing. At Punchcard, we believe they should be taught not just to <em>use</em> the technology of the moment, but how to craft creative solutions to the problems of the future.</p>
		<p>We also believe that students learn best when taught by masters of the craft. That's why we're working hard to place talented tech professionals in classrooms across the country, where they will teach the fundamentals of design and computer programming.</p>
		<p>Although we would like to partner with every interested school, our capacity is limited. If you believe that your school might be a good fit for Punchcard, <a href="https://ben28.typeform.com/to/TXqnRO">let's schedule a call</a>.</p>
